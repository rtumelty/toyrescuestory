,Lab Visit 2,,,,,,,
labvisit_02_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,All  materials are kept in the factory. This is where we keep the plastic blocks. Materials are used to build machines! ,,,,,,
labvisit_02_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,This is where we store the baby techno vines. They are very rare! ,,,,,,
labvisit_02_dialogue_03_Faradaydo,,Fresh re-chargable batteries are stored here. ,,,,,,
labvisit_02_dialogue_04_Miner,,Wait! You keep pieces from those dangerous tentacles here in the Lab? That's so dangerous! ,,,,,,
labvisit_02_dialogue_05_Faradaydo,,But of course! We need them to make rechargable batteries! Now come on; we have more toys to rescue! ,,,,,,
,Map Dialogues after Lab 2 Visit,,,,,,,
map_level_06_dialogue_01_Cora,,We found another miner to rescue! Let’s go get them!,,,,,,
map_level_07_08_09_dialogue_01_Cora,,Let’s rescue as many miners as we can; and make our way to the exit on the far side! ,,,,,,
map_level_10_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,Well we did it; we reached the train! But where is Jose Railway? He is the only one who can drive the train! We must find him!,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_01_dialogue_01_Jose,,Amigos! Thanks for saving me! Muchas Gracias! Those Tentacles had me drained; not even my chicken leg could re-charge me! ,,,,,,

map_trainlevel_01_dialogue_04_Jose,,Mi amor; my beautiful train! Oh how I missed you! Come; let us ride the train out of these miserable lower mines! ,,,,,,
,MAP 2,,,,,,,
map_level_12_dialogue_01_Cora,,We did it Faradaydo! We reached the upper mines! ,,,,,,
map_level_12_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,Indeed! And we made some new friends along the way!  ,,,,,,
map_level_12_dialogue_03_Jose,,Aye Caramba Faradaydo! Between those scary green flying bats and the tentacles; I nearly lost my appetite…*Chomp*...I said nearly lost! ,,,,,,
map_level_12_dialogue_04_Faradaydo,,Those tentacles seem to be evolving Jose! We must continue our journey through the upper mines; and escape to the surface of Sugra poste haste! ,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_01_Jose,Map 2 continued,Faradaydo!  How did a Block City engineer like you end up in these dirty old tunnels with Miner Toys like us?,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,The Toy Council banished me here after I told them that the battery mines would run out some day!  Those silly leaders! ,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_03_Jose,,I would have sent you here too! But now I see for myself; the mines did run out. Not so crazy now eh?,,,,,,
map_level_14_dialogue_01_Jose,,Cora; you are from Belleville; no? How did a pretty doll like you end up in these ugly old Mines? ,,,,,,
map_level_14_dialogue_02_Cora,,We couldn’t let our good friend Faradaydo be banished here alone; so we followed him! Didn’t we Madra? ,,,,,,
map_level_14_dialogue_03_Madra,,Woof Guuurrrufff! ,,,,,,
map_level_15_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,Look Jose! I see another train! Although it looks like there were some big rock falls! ,,,,,,
map_level_15_dialogue_02_Jose,,Caramba! I hope the train is still operational; because we need to ride it to the other side of the mines!,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_01_Jose,,¡Santo cielo! The track is filled with rocks! We will never make it across to the other side! ,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_02_Cora,,Oh no! What can we do! Could we just clear the rocks from the track? ,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_03_Jose,,There is only one hombre who can help us…the strongest  miner of them all... Come on; we will search for him! ,,,,,,
map_level_17_dialogue_01_Cora,,Jose; who is this Toy which you speak of with such strength and rock smashing ability? ,,,,,,
map_level_17_dialogue_02_Jose,,With the strength of a dozen toys; he makes a thunderous noise! Boz Holes! Boz holes! He breaks the rocks with his fists; and digs as fast as moles! Boz Holes! Boz Holes!,,,,,,
map_level_17_dialogue_03_Cora,,What a funny little song! We better go and find Boz Holes then!,,,,,,
map_level_18_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,Jose said this is the last known location of Boz Holes; let’s get in there and find him!,,,,,,
map_level_18_dialogue_02_Cora,,I hope Boz is not as big as the song says he is! I might not be able to get him onto my rescue trolley! ,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_02_dialogue_01_Boz,,GRUNT! Fuffle mreh hrrrr Tentacles HAAAARUMF!,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_02_dialogue_02_Jose,,Boz my Amigo; great to have you back!  Boz says the last thing he saw was a hundred tentacles attacking him; then he blacked out!,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_02_dialogue_03_Faradaydo,,A hundred tentacles? My word! Come with us Boz; we need you to break some rocks for us!  Let’s get to the train! ,,,,,,
map_level_19_dialogue_01_Cora,,Wahoo! We did it! We broke on through to the other side! How far now Jose?,,,,,,
map_level_19_dialogue_02_Jose,,We have to pass another mining station before we reach the main train which leads out of the mines. No fiesta yet Cora my amiga! ,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_01_Miner,,The other Miner Toys told me why the bridges are out! The bosses on the surface got scared and destroyed them to trap the tentacles in the mines!,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_02_Cora,,Oh how terrible! They must have been afraid the tentacles might escape to the surface! ,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_03_Miner,,I hope the last train out of here is still operational! I don’t want to become tentacle food…again! ,,,,,,
map_level_21_dialogue_01_Cora,,Oh Faradaydo; it is so wonderful to have some other toys around! For so long it was just you; me and Madra down here all alone!,,,,,,
map_level_21_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,Better company could not have been had! I wonder has anything changed on the surface? Not long now until we find out! ,,,,,,

map_level_22_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,What’s that Boz? You can smell the next mining station? Great! That means we are on the right track! ,,,,,,
map_minelevel_02_dialogue_01_Miner,,There it is! Mining Station 02. We used to mine for shiny shiny metal there!,,,,,,
map_minelevel_02_dialogue_02_Jose,,Good thing we have Boz Holes with us; the strongest; most bad ass miner there is; right Boz?,,,,,,
map_minelevel_02_dialogue_03_Boz,,Graarwr. BOZ SMASH!,,,,,,

map_level_23_dialogue_02_Cora,,That’s right Madra; the train is just around the corner! I could almost smell it; if I had a real nose that is! ,,,,,,
map_level_24_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,We made it to the train! Wait; what is this I see? By the great toy maker! How will we ever make it over that big gap in the tracks?,,,,,,
map_level_24_dialogue_02_Boz,,Harumf; Rnnnn Rnnnn RnnnnAAAAAAAWWR! ,,,,,,
map_level_24_dialogue_03_Jose,,Boz  my amigo; you are a genius! The power motor can give us the speed we need!  Come on; I know where to find it! ,,,,,,
map_level_25_dialogue_01_Cora,,Jose; it is so good we found you! We would be lost without your Knowledge of the mines! ,,,,,,
map_level_25_dialogue_02_Jose,,Cora mi amiga! If your rescue team had not found me; I would be tentacle food! ,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_03_dialogue_01_Cora,,Tell me we have everything we need to get out of these dark and dangerous mines now Jose? I miss the sunshine and playtime!,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_03_dialogue_02_Jose,,We are ready Cora! The power motor is mounted; and my train; she is ready for her epic bridge jump!,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_03_dialogue_03_Cora,,Yipppeee! Time to see the surface! There’s no time to waste! Let’s roll rescue team! ,,,,,,
map_level_26_dialogue_01_Cora,,Yippee! We did it Faradaydo!  We reached the surface!  And look; it’s Block City; your home! It must feel great to finally see it again! ,,,,,,
map_level_26_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,Today is a great day Cora! Wait… something is wrong… … the whole city should be buzzing with activity!,,,,,,
map_level_26_dialogue_03_Cora,,It does look very quiet…Did the whole city run out of batteries? Maybe the tentacles got to the surface before us!,,,,,,
map_level_26_dialogue_03_Faradaydo,,By the great spanner of the toy maker! We have to investigate right away Cora! Gather the team; we have more toys to rescue!,,,,,,
