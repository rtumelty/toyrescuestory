map_level_12_dialogue_03_Jose,,Aye Caramba Faradaydo! Between those scary green flying bats and the tentacles; I nearly lost my appetiteâ€¦*Chomp*...I said nearly lost! ,,,,,,
map_level_12_dialogue_04_Faradaydo,,Those tentacles seem to be evolving Jose! We must continue our journey through the upper mines; and escape to the surface of Sugra poste haste! ,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_01_Jose,Map 2 continued,Faradaydo!  How did a Block City engineer like you end up in these dirty old tunnels with Miner Toys like us?,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_02_Faradaydo,,The Toy Council banished me here after I told them that the battery mines would run out some day! Â Those silly leaders! ,,,,,,
map_level_13_dialogue_03_Jose,,I would have sent you here too! But now I see for myself; the mines did run out. Not so crazy now eh?,,,,,,
map_level_14_dialogue_01_Jose,,Cora; you are from Belleville; no? How did a pretty doll like you end up in these ugly old Mines? ,,,,,,
map_level_14_dialogue_02_Cora,,We couldnâ€™t let our good friend Faradaydo be banished here alone; so we followed him! Didnâ€™t we Madra? ,,,,,,

map_level_15_dialogue_02_Jose,,Caramba! I hope the train is still operational; because we need to ride it to the other side of the mines!,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_01_Jose,,Â¡Santo cielo! The track is filled with rocks! We will never make it across to the other side! ,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_02_Cora,,Oh no! What can we do! Could we just clear the rocks from the track? ,,,,,,
map_level_16_dialogue_03_Jose,,There is only one hombre who can help usâ€¦the strongest Â miner of them all... Come on; we will search for him! ,,,,,,
map_level_17_dialogue_01_Cora,,Jose; who is this Toy which you speak of with such strength and rock smashing ability? ,,,,,,

map_level_17_dialogue_03_Cora,,What a funny little song! We better go and find Boz Holes then!,,,,,,
map_level_18_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,Jose said this is the last known location of Boz Holes; letâ€™s get in there and find him!,,,,,,
map_level_18_dialogue_02_Cora,,I hope Boz is not as big as the song says he is! I might not be able to get him onto my rescue trolley! ,,,,,,

map_level_19_dialogue_01_Cora,,Wahoo! We did it! We broke on through to the other side! How far now Jose?,,,,,,
map_level_19_dialogue_02_Jose,,We have to pass another mining station before we reach the main train which leads out of the mines. No fiesta yet Cora my amiga! ,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_01_Miner,,The other Miner Toys told me why the bridges are out! The bosses on the surface got scared and destroyed them to trap the tentacles in the mines!,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_02_Cora,,Oh how terrible! They must have been afraid the tentacles might escape to the surface! ,,,,,,
map_level_20_dialogue_03_Miner,,I hope the last train out of here is still operational! I donâ€™t want to become tentacle foodâ€¦again! ,,,,,,
map_level_21_dialogue_01_Cora,,Oh Faradaydo; it is so wonderful to have some other toys around! For so long it was just you; me and Madra down here all alone!,,,,,,

map_level_24_dialogue_01_Faradaydo,,We made it to the train! Wait; what is this I see? By the great toy maker! How will we ever make it over that big gap in the tracks?,,,,,,
map_level_24_dialogue_02_Boz,,Harumf; Rnnnn Rnnnn RnnnnAAAAAAAWWR! ,,,,,,
map_level_24_dialogue_03_Jose,,Boz Â my amigo; you are a genius! The power motor can give us the speed we need! Â Come on; I know where to find it! ,,,,,,
map_level_25_dialogue_01_Cora,,Jose; it is so good we found you! We would be lost without your Knowledge of the mines! ,,,,,,
map_level_25_dialogue_02_Jose,,Cora mi amiga! If your rescue team had not found me; I would be tentacle food! ,,,,,,
map_trainlevel_03_dialogue_01_Cora,,Tell me we have everything we need to get out of these dark and dangerous mines now Jose? I miss the sunshine and playtime!,,,,,,

map_level_26_dialogue_03_Cora,,It does look very quietâ€¦Did the whole city run out of batteries? Maybe the tentacles got to the surface before us!,,,,,,
map_level_26_dialogue_03_Faradaydo,,By the great spanner of the toy maker! We have to investigate right away Cora! Gather the team; we have more toys to rescue!,,,,,,
